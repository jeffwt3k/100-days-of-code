# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday, April 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a tiny bit of FreeCodeCamp's front end development course (Bootstrap). Googled a few things (container sizes, id vs. class, etc.) Realized just how much there is to learn. Decided on 100 Days of Code challenge.

**Thoughts:** Nervous. Don't know that I can commit a full hour every day to coding. Time will tell!

**Link to work:** Rediscovered this bit that I made the first time I started FreeCodeCamp: (https://codepen.io/jeffwt3k/pen/WoqQMx)


### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
