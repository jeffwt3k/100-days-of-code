# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday, April 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a tiny bit of FreeCodeCamp's front end development course (Bootstrap). Googled a few things (container sizes, id vs. class, etc.) Realized just how much there is to learn. Decided on 100 Days of Code challenge. EDIT: Later, worked on a new version of that first project, for my very own doggos! Figured building the tribut page would help me remember all that I've forgotten up to this point :)

**Thoughts:** Nervous. Don't know that I can commit a full hour every day to coding. Time will tell!

**Link to work:** Rediscovered this bit that I made the first time I started FreeCodeCamp: (https://codepen.io/jeffwt3k/pen/WoqQMx)

Re-committing to 100 Days of Code. I've been coding a good bit for the past few weeks, but it's now time to up my game! Every day for 100 days! I'll do the following:
- Work through freeCodeCamp's intro to JavaScript section!
- Work through Bootstrap section of The Web Developer Bootcamp course from Colt Steele...
- Work through the entirety of CSS: The Complete Guide from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and Manuel Lorenz!
- I will finish my actual portfolio site
- I will begin to see and present myself as a web developer
- I will create my first website for an organization or person to use!

**Today's Progress**: WILL UPDATE AT END OF DAY
