# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Monday, April 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a tiny bit of FreeCodeCamp's front end development course (Bootstrap). Googled a few things (container sizes, id vs. class, etc.) Realized just how much there is to learn. Decided on 100 Days of Code challenge. EDIT: Later, worked on a new version of that first project, for my very own doggos! Figured building the tribut page would help me remember all that I've forgotten up to this point :)

**Thoughts:** Nervous. Don't know that I can commit a full hour every day to coding. Time will tell!

**Link to work:** Rediscovered this bit that I made the first time I started FreeCodeCamp: (https://codepen.io/jeffwt3k/pen/WoqQMx)

### Day 0: Monday, May 7, 2018

Re-committing to 100 Days of Code. I've been coding a good bit for the past few weeks, but it's now time to up my game! Every day for 100 days! I'll do the following:
- Work through freeCodeCamp's intro to JavaScript section!
- Work through Bootstrap section of The Web Developer Bootcamp course from Colt Steele...
- Work through the entirety of CSS: The Complete Guide from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and Manuel Lorenz!
- I will finish my actual portfolio site
- I will begin to see and present myself as a web developer
- I will create my first website for an organization or person to use!

**Today's Progress**: WILL UPDATE AT END OF DAY

**Thoughts:** Nervous. Don't know that I can commit a full hour every day to coding. Time will tell!

### Day 1: Tuesday, May 8, 2018

Today I took the CSS that I had created for my webpage and scrapped most of it - it was a disorganized mess, and I can do better.

It is part of a concept I'm trying for my portfolio (not yet published). Essentially, I want to practice my CSS and HTML skills and show them off throught the creation of my own "CSS Zen Garden." The first iteration, I've decided, will be one in which I style the base HTML of my portfolio with a CSS style sheet that only uses elements and pseudo-elements as targets for styling (no IDs or classes!) I hope this will help me to develop a thorough understanding of the ways in which I can use selector combinations to target specific bits.

**Today's Progress**: Re-worked part of the CSS to create the header and parallax imagery on the site.

**Thoughts:** Feelin' good!

**Link to work:** N/A (on my compy!)



### Day 2: Wednesday, May 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Scrapped old CSS as it was too difficult and unorganized - decided I will challenge myself and only style the HTML using elements and pseudo-elements. Working well so far, but there are definite hiccups in getting the page to be responsive like I want!

**Thoughts:** Loving the challenge!

**Link to work:** N/A (on my compy, website coming soon!)



### Day 3: Thursday, May 10, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Purchased domain! Worked on fine details of site - making everything justttt right!

### Day 4: Friday, May 11, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Set up blog, continued fine tuning, especially with the mobile stuff. It's really difficult, but I found @media queries to be a real help.

**Thoughts:** I know my page should be mobile first, but right now, it's just simpler to add @media queries to modify code for smaller screens. I'll come back and change it later :)
